# CS100_FALL2020
Work that I have done in my Software Construction class (CS100) during FALL 2020.

In this class, I learned how to collaborate with others and the process of developing a project as a team. We had weekly labs that tested our capabilities of using
design patterns, creating proper testings, and our ability to use git/github to work as a team.
